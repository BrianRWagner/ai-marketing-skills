## What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are an [open standard](https://agentskills.io) for packaging expertise as instructions that AI agents can follow.

Traditional content: You read it → You apply it → You forget half of it.

Agent Skills: Your agent reads it → Your agent applies it → Every time. Perfectly.
