# 🧑‍💼 AI Employee Onboarding Wizard

**Go from zero to a fully configured AI employee in 15 minutes.**

No more staring at blank config files wondering what to write. This skill walks you (or your clients) through a guided conversation and generates 7 production-ready files that define your AI agent's personality, behavior, memory, and workflow.

## What You Get

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `IDENTITY.md` | Agent name, emoji, vibe, and personality archetype |
| `SOUL.md` | Core personality, communication style, anti-patterns, security boundaries |
| `AGENTS.md` | Workspace rules, memory protocol, session behavior, safety guidelines |
| `USER.md` | Your role, preferences, goals, and pet peeves |
| `MEMORY.md` | Starter long-term memory template with day-one context |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Proactive check-in checklist tailored to your role |
| `TOOLS.md` | Integration notes template for your tool stack |

## How It Works

1. **Run the skill** — Your agent starts a guided conversation
2. **Answer ~15 questions** — Asked 2-3 at a time, not all at once
3. **Smart defaults kick in** — Tell it you're a marketer and it auto-configures for marketing workflows
4. **Get your files** — Drop them into `.openclaw/` and you're live

## Built-In Intelligence

- **6 role-based default profiles** — Marketer, Developer, Founder, Consultant, Ops/PM, Researcher
- **5 personality archetypes** — Operator, Strategist, Builder, Creative, Partner
- **Cron job suggestions** — Role-appropriate scheduled tasks
- **Multi-agent architecture templates** — For when one agent isn't enough

## Who This Is For

- **New OpenClaw users** who want to skip the setup learning curve
- **Agencies** onboarding clients onto AI assistants
- **Teams** standardizing their AI employee configurations
- **Anyone** who'd rather answer questions than write YAML

## Built By
