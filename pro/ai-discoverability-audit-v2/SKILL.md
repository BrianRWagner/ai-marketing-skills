**Price:** $19  
**Author:** Brian Wagner (@BrianRWagner)  
**Category:** Marketing  

> "Find out if AI can find you — and fix it before your competitors do."

---

## Description

Use when a founder, marketer, or consultant wants to audit how visible their brand or website is to AI search engines and LLMs. Also use when the user mentions "AI SEO," "GEO," "AEO," "AI discoverability," "ChatGPT can't find me," "Perplexity results," "AI search visibility," or "how do I show up in AI answers."

This is a full audit of your brand's visibility to AI systems — ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, Google AI Overviews. Not traditional SEO. AI-specific discoverability. You'll get a score, specific gaps, and a 30-day action plan to fix it.

---

## What This Audit Covers

✅ How AI systems currently describe your brand  
✅ Whether you show up in AI answers for your core use cases  
✅ Entity clarity — can an LLM summarize you accurately in one sentence?  
✅ Content signal strength — do you publish what AI can extract and cite?  
✅ Schema and structured data audit  
✅ Third-party validation signals  
✅ 30-day prioritized fix plan  

## What This Audit Does NOT Cover

❌ Traditional Google SEO rankings  
❌ Content writing or copywriting  
❌ Social media performance  

---

## Inputs Required

Before starting, gather:

1. **Brand/company name**
2. **Website URL**
3. **Primary ICP** — who you sell to (1 sentence)
4. **Top 3 use cases** — problems you solve
5. **2-3 closest competitors** (optional but recommended)

---

## The 6-Section Audit Framework

### Section 1: AI Presence Score (0-100)

Query your brand in 5 AI search scenarios. Simulate real user queries:

- "best [category] tool for [ICP]"
- "[problem] solution for [industry]"
- "alternative to [competitor]"
- "[brand name] reviews"
- "how to [use case your product solves]"

**Scoring:**
- Appears in top answer: 20 points each
- Mentioned anywhere in response: 10 points each
- Not found: 0 points

Run these queries in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. Average the results.

If competitors were provided, benchmark against them: "You scored 45. Competitor A scored 70. Competitor B scored 35."

---

### Section 2: Entity Clarity

**The test:** Can an LLM summarize your brand accurately in one sentence?

Ask ChatGPT/Perplexity: "What does [brand] do?"

Compare the response to what you actually do. 

**Common failures:**
- Too many offerings, no single clear position
- Outdated information from old press/directories
- Confusion with similarly-named companies
- Generic category placement ("a software company")

**Score:**
- **Clear** — AI gets it right in one sentence
- **Muddy** — AI is vague, wrong, or confused → specific fix required

If muddy, identify exactly what's causing the confusion and recommend the fix (homepage clarity, about page rewrite, directory cleanup).

---

### Section 3: Content Signal Strength

Does your brand publish content AI systems can extract and cite?

**Check:**
- Does the site have a clear /blog or /resources section?
- Do posts answer specific questions your ICP would ask an AI?
- Are there data points, stats, or original research AI can reference?
- Is content structured with clear headings, summaries, and takeaways?

**Score:**
- **Strong** — Regular publishing, structured content, citable data
- **Weak** — Content exists but unstructured or generic
- **Missing** — No blog, no resources, nothing for AI to cite

Identify specific gaps: "Your blog has 12 posts but none answer the top 5 questions your ICP asks AI. Here are those questions: [list]"

---

### Section 4: Structured Data & Schema

Does your site use schema markup that helps AI systems understand who you are?

**Key schemas to check:**
- Organization
- WebSite
- Product (if applicable)
- FAQ
- Article (on blog posts)

**How to check:** Use Google's Rich Results Test or Schema.org validator.

**Score:**
- **Implemented correctly** — Key schemas present and valid
- **Missing** — No schema markup
- **Incorrect** — Schema present but errors/warnings

Provide specific implementation recommendations.

---

### Section 5: Third-Party Validation

AI systems trust external sources. Are there signals outside your website that validate your brand?

**Check for:**
- LinkedIn company page (complete, active)
- G2/Capterra reviews (if B2B SaaS)
- Industry directory listings
- Press mentions or guest posts
- Partner pages that mention you
- Case studies on client websites

**Score:**
- **Strong** — Multiple external signals, consistent information
- **Weak** — Few external mentions, inconsistent data
- **Missing** — Brand exists only on its own website

Identify the highest-impact validation signals to pursue.

---

### Section 6: The 30-Day Signal Fix

**Week 1: Foundation (Quick Wins)**

## Example Output

Here's a complete audit for a fictional SaaS company:

---

# AI Discoverability Audit — Clearpath Analytics

*Audited: February 21, 2026 | Framework: Signal Audit v2*

## Overall Signal Score: 38/100

### Section 1: AI Presence [38/100]

| Query | ChatGPT | Perplexity | Claude | Score |
|-------|---------|------------|--------|-------|
| "best analytics tool for e-commerce" | Not mentioned | Not mentioned | Not mentioned | 0 |
| "Shopify analytics solution" | Mentioned in list | Top 3 answer | Not mentioned | 30 |
| "alternative to Triple Whale" | Not mentioned | Mentioned | Not mentioned | 10 |
| "Clearpath Analytics reviews" | Accurate summary | Accurate | Outdated info | 50 |
| "how to track e-commerce LTV" | Not mentioned | Not mentioned | Not mentioned | 0 |

**Competitor Benchmark:**
- Triple Whale: 72/100
- Northbeam: 65/100
- Clearpath: 38/100

**Gap:** You're invisible for category queries. AI only finds you when users already know your name.

---

### Section 2: Entity Clarity [FAIL]

**What ChatGPT says:** "Clearpath Analytics is a data analytics company that provides business intelligence solutions."

**What you actually do:** "E-commerce analytics platform that tracks customer LTV and attribution for Shopify brands."

**Problem:** Your positioning is too generic. AI sees "analytics company" — a category with 10,000 competitors. Your specific value prop (e-commerce, LTV, Shopify) isn't reaching AI systems.

**Fix:** Rewrite homepage H1 and about page to lead with "E-commerce LTV analytics for Shopify brands" — not "analytics platform."

---

### Section 3: Content Signals [WEAK]

- Blog exists: ✅ (14 posts)
- Answers ICP questions: ❌ (posts are product updates, not problem-solving)
- Citable data: ❌ (no original research, no benchmarks)
- Structure: ⚠️ (missing summaries, no FAQ schema)

**Gap:** Your blog talks about your product. AI needs content that answers questions your ICP asks. 

**Top 5 questions Shopify brand owners ask AI:**
1. "How do I calculate customer LTV?"
2. "What's a good LTV:CAC ratio for e-commerce?"
3. "How do I track attribution after iOS 14?"
4. "Triple Whale vs Northbeam comparison"
5. "Best analytics for Shopify Plus"

You have zero content ranking for these. That's your content roadmap.

---

### Section 4: Schema & Structure [1/3]

| Schema | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Organization | ✅ Present |
| Product | ❌ Missing |
| FAQ | ❌ Missing |
| Article | ❌ Missing on blog posts |

**Fix:** Add Product schema to pricing page. Add FAQ schema to homepage and feature pages. Add Article schema to all blog posts.

---

### Section 5: Third-Party Validation [WEAK]

| Signal | Status |
|--------|--------|
| LinkedIn | ⚠️ Incomplete (no description, 200 followers) |
| G2 | ❌ No listing |
| Capterra | ❌ No listing |
| Industry directories | ⚠️ Listed on 1 (Shopify App Store) |
| Press/guest posts | ❌ None found |
| Partner mentions | ❌ None found |

**Gap:** Clearpath exists almost entirely on its own website. AI has no external signals to validate your authority.

## Decision Logic

- **Score > 70:** Focus on competitor gap analysis and maintaining position. You're visible — now own the category.
- **Score 40-70:** Prioritize entity clarity and content signals. Foundation is there but AI isn't citing you.
- **Score < 40:** Start with entity clarity and schema. No point building content before the foundation is right.

---

## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- No generic SEO advice — this is AI-specific only
- No "just create more content" — every recommendation must be specific and actionable
- Call out the exact gap, not just the category
- Tone: Direct, confident, no fluff. See VOICE-PROFILE.md.
