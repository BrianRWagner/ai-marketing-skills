## What It Does

Routes your business questions through the decision frameworks of elite founders, operators, and capital allocators — distilled from a decade-plus of books, podcasts, articles, and obsessive note-taking.

Not motivational advice. Not generic "it depends." Decision-quality output with clear tradeoffs, named risks, and first actions.

## The Lenses

| Lens | What It Sees |
|------|-------------|
| **Bezos Flywheel** | Compounding systems, reinvestment, platform dynamics |
| **Buffett Capital Discipline** | Economic reality, pricing power, durable moats |
| **Porter Competitive Strategy** | Structural positioning, tradeoffs, what you're choosing NOT to do |
| **Helmer 7 Powers** | Moat identification, why competitors can't copy you |
| **Howard Marks Risk** | Downside intelligence, second-order thinking, survival |
| **Ferriss Small Bets** | Experimentation, reversibility, smallest action that gives signal |
| **Trader Joe's** | Economic differentiation, curation vs. breadth, operational simplicity |
| **Red Bull Cultural Dominance** | Category creation, narrative strategy, engineering belief |
| **Watkins Execution** | Momentum, early wins, translating strategy into action |

## How It Works

1. **Business Intake** — Captures your stage, constraints, and time horizon before any analysis
2. **Decision Router** — Classifies your question and selects 2–4 lenses that create productive tension
3. **Structured Analysis** — Runs each lens against your specific context (not generic advice)
4. **Recommendation** — Makes a call with named advantages, risks avoided, and capabilities built
5. **Iteration Loop** — Go deeper, steelman the opposite, swap lenses, shift time horizon, or chain into the next decision

## Example Questions It Handles

- "We're in a crowded market and competitors look identical. How do we stand out?"
- "Should I scale now or keep iterating?"
- "Is this business model actually good or just a great story?"
- "I'm stepping into a new leadership role. What do I focus on first?"
- "We're growing fast. How do I know if we're building real advantage or just riding a wave?"
