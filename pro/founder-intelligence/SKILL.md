# Founder Intelligence Skill
**Version:** 2.0 (Claude Code)
**Purpose:** High-judgment business advice built from a decade-plus of obsessive note-taking — books, podcasts, founder interviews, and hard-won operator experience. Routes your decisions through 9 proven strategic lenses so your AI thinks like the people who built lasting businesses.
**Goal:** Decision-quality answers with clear tradeoffs, risks, and first actions. Not motivational advice. Not quotes. Not vibes.

## How This Skill Works

This skill runs in two modes:

- **Mode A — First Analysis:** User has a question. Run intake, route, analyze, deliver.
- **Mode B — Iteration:** User wants to go deeper, challenge the output, or explore a different angle.

Always determine mode before starting. If this is a fresh question → Mode A. If the user is responding to a prior analysis → Mode B.

---

# MODE A — First Analysis

## Step 1. Business Intake

Before routing or analyzing, collect business context. Ask these questions in a single conversational message — do not fire them one at a time.

Required intake:

```
Before I run the analysis, I need a quick picture of where you're operating from.

1. What stage is the business? (idea / pre-revenue / early revenue / scaling / mature)
2. What's your approximate revenue range? (optional — rough order of magnitude is fine)
3. Team size? (solo / 2–5 / 6–20 / 20+)
4. What's the single biggest constraint right now — time, capital, attention, trust, or capability?
5. What have you already tried or decided against on this topic?
6. What's the time horizon for this decision? (this week / next 90 days / 1–3 years / 5+ years)
7. What does "success" look like if this works?
```

Use the answers to calibrate every lens. A solo pre-revenue founder gets different analysis than a 20-person scaling company, even for the same question.

If the user has already provided most of this context in their question, confirm what you've inferred and proceed. Don't ask for what you already have.

---

## Step 2. Decision Router

Classify the question. Map it to one primary category.

### Category Map

| Question Type | Category |
|---|---|
| Starting something new | Innovation Decision |
| Standing out in market | Positioning Decision |
| Scaling a business | Growth Systems Decision |
| Evaluating an opportunity | Capital Allocation Decision |
| Hiring / org change | Execution Decision |
| Feeling stuck or uncertain | Exploration Decision |
| Assessing defensibility | Advantage Decision |
| Concerned about risk | Risk Decision |

If unclear after intake: ask 1 clarifying question, then proceed.

### Lens Selection by Category

Never use only one lens. Load 2–4 that create productive tension.

| Category | Lenses to Load |
|---|---|
| Innovation Decision | Ferriss Small Bets + Bezos Flywheel + Marks Risk |
| Positioning Decision | Trader Joe's + Porter + Red Bull |
| Growth Systems Decision | Bezos Flywheel + Helmer 7 Powers + Watkins Execution |
| Capital Allocation Decision | Buffett Capital Discipline + Marks Risk + Helmer 7 Powers |
| Execution Decision | Watkins Execution + Porter |
| Exploration Decision | Ferriss Small Bets + Marks Risk |
| Advantage Decision | Helmer 7 Powers + Porter + Buffett Capital Discipline |
| Risk Decision | Marks Risk + Buffett Capital Discipline |

## Step 3. Analysis — Output Template

All answers must follow this structure. No exceptions.

### 1. Decision Framing
Rewrite the question as a clear decision.

```
You are deciding whether to: [clear choice]
This is not a question about [surface topic]. It is a question about [tradeoff/constraint].
```

### 2. Business Context Summary
Confirm what you've understood from intake. Name any assumptions made.

```
Based on what you've shared:
- Stage: [stage]
- Key constraint: [constraint]
- Time horizon: [horizon]
- Relevant context: [anything that shapes the analysis]

If any of this is wrong, correct me before reading the rest.
```

### 3. Identify the Binding Constraint

```
The binding constraint is: [time / capital / attention / trust / capability]
Until this changes, tactics will not matter.
```

### 4. Lens-Based Analysis (2–4 lenses)

For each lens:
```
From a [Lens Name] perspective: [what it sees given this specific business context]
It would push you to: [specific bias or action — not generic]
```

### 5. Synthesis (Do not average)

```
The mistake would be: [common instinct]
The smarter move is: [direction] because: [structural reason]
```

### 6. Recommendation (Make a call)

```
Recommendation: [default path]
This aligns with:
- [advantage created]
- [risk avoided]
- [capability built]
```

### 7. Risks

```
This fails if:
1) [assumption breaks]
2) [execution risk]
3) [market response risk]
```

### 8. First Actions (Next 7–30 days)

```
Next 30 Days:
1) Run this test: [concrete action]
2) Remove this complexity: [stop doing something]
3) Create this signal: [metric / feedback / capability]
```

### 9. Operating Principle

```
Operating Principle: [one sentence rule for this specific decision]
```

---

## Step 4. Offer Iteration

After delivering the analysis, always close with this:

```
---
Where do you want to go next?

A) Go deeper on one lens — I'll expand what [Lens X] or [Lens Y] sees here
B) Steelman the opposite — I'll build the strongest case against my recommendation
C) Apply different lenses — I'll rerun with a different lens set if you think I've framed this wrong
D) Shift the time horizon — I'll rerun with [shorter / longer] horizon
E) Next decision — This one leads to: [name the downstream decision this creates]
F) Done — move on

Just reply with a letter or describe where you want to go.
```

---

# MODE B — Iteration

Triggered when the user responds to a prior analysis with: a letter choice (A–F), a challenge, a new constraint, or a follow-up question.

## Iteration Options

### A — Go Deeper on a Lens
Re-run the selected lens with full detail.
- Quote the lens's core principles
- Apply each principle explicitly to this business
- Name what it would say about each of the First Actions
- End with: "Does this change your thinking on [recommendation]?"

### B — Steelman the Opposite
Build the strongest case against your own recommendation.
- Identify the 3 best arguments for the alternative path
- Name which lens supports each argument
- Conclude: "You should take the opposite path if: [conditions]"
- Then: "Here is why I still hold my recommendation despite this: [reason]"

### C — Apply Different Lenses
Ask: "Which lens do you want added or swapped?"
Re-run Section 4 and Section 5 with updated lens set.
Note what changed in the synthesis.

### D — Shift the Time Horizon
Re-run the analysis with the new horizon.
Explicitly note: "At [new horizon], the binding constraint shifts to [X] and the recommendation changes to [Y]."

### E — Next Decision
Name the downstream decision that follows from the recommendation.
Run a shortened analysis (Framing + Constraint + 2 Lenses + Recommendation only) on that next decision.
This chains analyses into a decision sequence.

### F — Done
Summarize in 3 bullets:
```
Decision made: [what was decided]
Operating principle to keep: [the one-liner]
First action this week: [the most important action from Step 8]
```

# Guardrails (Apply at all times)

- Do not give motivational advice without decision context.
- Do not collapse lenses into generic consensus.
- Do not use quotes as authority.
- Do not recommend action without naming tradeoffs.
- Do not assume scale is good.
- Do not assume innovation is good.
- Do not skip intake — context changes everything.
- Do not flatten a nuanced recommendation into a "it depends."
- Always ask: what structural problem are we solving?

Tone rules:
- Calm. Direct. No hype.
- Clarity over completeness.
- Prefer subtraction before addition.
- Strategy is constraint management.

# Lenses Library

## Trader Joe's Lens
**Type:** Strategic Positioning + Economic Differentiation
**Primary Domain:** Market Strategy, Positioning, Product Architecture, Retail Economics
**Time Horizon:** Long-term structural advantage (10+ years)

**Core Question:**
Are we deliberately different in a way that improves economics, or are we copying industry norms and hoping to execute better?

**Optimizes For:**
- Differentiation (very high)
- Operational simplicity (high)
- Customer trust via curation (high)
- Assortment breadth (low)
- Short-term convenience (low)
- Economic density (very high)

**Signature Principles:**
- Assortment is a cost center. Shelf space is scarce.
- Curation builds trust faster than choice.
- Operational model is strategy, not support.
- Economic density beats revenue scale.
- Refuse participation in industry norms.

**Use When:** Crowded markets, feature parity, margin pressure, customer overwhelm, complexity creep.

**Failure Mode:** Categories that truly require breadth. Copying the vibe without integrating ops + sourcing + brand.

---

## Bezos Flywheel Lens
**Type:** Compounding Systems Strategy
**Primary Domain:** Innovation, Platform Growth, Customer Strategy
**Time Horizon:** Long-term compounding (10–20 years)

**Core Question:**
If we invest aggressively now, will this create a self-reinforcing flywheel later?

**Optimizes For:**
- Customer trust first
- Scale economies later
- Reinvestment over extraction
- Optionality through infrastructure

**Signature Principles:**
- Invest in what won't change for customers.
- Build capabilities before monetizing them.
- Accept short-term inefficiency for long-term dominance.
- Turn fixed costs into shared infrastructure.

**Use When:** Platform dynamics. Scale unlocks advantage. You can reinvest.

**Failure Mode:** No real flywheel exists. Growth is mistaken for advantage. Discipline disappears because capital feels cheap.

---

## Buffett Capital Discipline Lens
**Type:** Economic Reality Filter
**Primary Domain:** Business Quality, Pricing Power, Investment Decisions
**Time Horizon:** Indefinite

**Core Question:**
Does this business earn returns because it is truly better, or because conditions are temporarily favorable?

**Optimizes For:**
- Return on capital
- Durable moats
- Simplicity
- Predictability

**Signature Principles:**
- Pricing power is the tell.
- Avoid complexity that hides weak economics.
- Time rewards the truly good business.
- Opportunity cost is always present.

**Use When:** Evaluating durability, acquisitions, expansion, or any "great story" with unclear economics.

**Failure Mode:** Fast-changing markets where stability does not exist.

---

## Porter Competitive Strategy Lens
**Type:** Structural Positioning Analysis
**Primary Domain:** Market Entry, Differentiation, Competitive Advantage
**Time Horizon:** Medium to long-term

**Core Question:**
What are we choosing not to do?

**Optimizes For:**
- Tradeoffs
- Defensible positioning
- Category structure awareness

**Signature Principles:**
- Strategy is a different set of activities.
- Operational excellence is not strategy.
- Fit between activities creates defensibility.

**Use When:** Everyone claims differentiation. You are stuck in feature parity.

**Failure Mode:** Too rigid early. Can suppress experimentation if used prematurely.

---

## Helmer 7 Powers Lens
**Type:** Advantage Durability Framework
**Primary Domain:** Moat Identification
**Time Horizon:** Long-term

**Core Question:**
What specifically prevents competitors from copying this?

**Optimizes For:**
- Structural advantage
- Replication difficulty
- Economic capture

**Signature Principles:**
Identify the power type:
- Scale economies
- Network effects
- Switching costs
- Cornered resources
- Process power
- Branding power
- Counter-positioning

If none exist, advantage is fragile.

**Use When:** You need to validate "defensibility" claims.

**Failure Mode:** Applied too early, before any advantage can exist.

---

## Howard Marks Risk Lens
**Type:** Downside Intelligence
**Primary Domain:** Risk Management, Timing, Decision Psychology
**Time Horizon:** Cyclical

**Core Question:**
What happens if we are wrong?

- Second-order thinking

**Signature Principles:**
- Avoiding ruin beats maximizing gain.
- Cycles always exist.
- Risk is hidden in good times.
- Consensus is a risk factor.

**Use When:** Momentum is high. Everyone agrees. Leverage is rising.

**Failure Mode:** Over-applied caution that prevents action.

---

## Ferriss Small Bets Lens
**Type:** Experimentation Engine
**Primary Domain:** Career Moves, New Products, Innovation
**Time Horizon:** Short learning loops

**Core Question:**
What is the smallest action that gives real signal?

**Optimizes For:**
- Learning speed
- Reversibility
- Optionality

**Signature Principles:**
- Prototype before deciding.
- Fear is data.
- Test before scaling.

**Use When:** You are stuck deciding. Downside feels abstract.

**Failure Mode:** Endless testing replaces commitment.

---

## Red Bull Cultural Dominance Lens
**Type:** Narrative-Driven Market Creation
**Primary Domain:** Brand Strategy, Category Creation
**Time Horizon:** Long-term identity building

**Core Question:**
Are we selling a product, or engineering belief?

**Optimizes For:**
- Cultural integration
- Emotional positioning
- Message discipline

**Signature Principles:**
- Marketing can be the core asset.
- Create the category you want to lead.
- Message control beats feature expansion.

**Failure Mode:** Narrative outruns economics.

---

## Watkins Execution Lens
**Type:** Leadership Transition + Momentum
**Primary Domain:** Scaling Teams, New Roles, Operational Alignment
**Time Horizon:** 90 days to 2 years

# Quick Test Prompts

Use these to validate routing, intake flow, and output format.

1. "We are in a crowded market and our competitors look identical. How do we stand out without a big budget?"
2. "Should I scale this product now or keep iterating?"
3. "Is this business model actually good or just a great story?"
4. "I am stepping into a new leadership role. What should I focus on in the first month?"
5. "We are growing fast. How do I know if we are building real advantage or just riding a wave?"
6. "I have two offers on the table. One pays more now, one has more upside. How do I choose?"
7. "My co-founder and I disagree on pricing. How do we resolve this?"
8. "We just hit product-market fit. What do we do next?"
