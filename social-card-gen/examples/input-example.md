# Product update: onboarding improvements

This week we shipped a guided onboarding checklist for new users. In testing, setup time dropped from 45 minutes to 28 minutes, and week-1 activation improved by 19%.

The biggest win came from replacing long setup docs with short in-app prompts at the exact moment users needed each step.

Next, we're adding role-based onboarding paths so teams can skip irrelevant setup screens.
