I just read this and wanted to sanity-check my take: Product update: onboarding improvements This week we shipped a guided onboarding checklist for new users.

In testing, setup time dropped from 45 minutes to 28 minutes, and week-1 activation improved by 19%. The biggest win came from replacing long setup docs with short in-app prompts at the exact moment users needed each step.

Curious how others here handle this.
